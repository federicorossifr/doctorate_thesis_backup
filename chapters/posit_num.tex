\chapter{Posit numbers}



\section{The posit idea}

Posit numbers made their first appearance in the work of John L. Gustfason "Beating Floating Point at its Own Game: Posit Arithmetic" \cite{gustafson2017beating}. The idea behind the format was to create a drop-in replacement for binary32 numbers. Posit numbers can be also seen as a new iteration of Universal Numbers (also called \textit{unum}). We can consider Posits as TypeIII unums.


Type I unums are a super-set of binary32 numbers, that are extended with an additional bit, called \textit{ubit}, that states whether the real number represented by that unum is an exact binary32 or lies between two consecutive representations. Another difference with binary32 numbers is that unums do not have a predefined length for exponent and fraction fields. Type I unums are also a way to represent interval arithmetic in a compact format. 

The second iteration of Type I unums - namely, Type II unums - points in the direction of totally abandoning the compatibility with binary32 numbers, nearing the concept of \textit{projective reals}.
This means that Type II unums can be projected into a ring, that wraps around from positive to negative numbers.

The final iteration of unums is represented by the Type III unum, also called Posit.


\section{Format and general properties}

Posit numbers are stored in two's complement integers. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:positFormat}, a Posit number is comprised by at most four fields. It can be configured on two parameters: the number of total bits $\text{nbits}$ and the maximum number of exponent bits $\text{esbits}$
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textcolor{asparago}{S} is the sign bit as commonly used in IEEE binary formats.
    \item \textcolor{amber}{Regime} is the regime field, on variable length; it can take up to the entire remaining bit-space of the format.
    \item \textcolor{lightred}{Exponent} is the exponent field, without any bias offset; depending on $esbits$ and regime length it can span from $0$ to $esbits$ bits.
    \item \textcolor{lightgreen}{Fraction} is the fractional part of the mantissa; depending on the other fields it can be absent.
\end{itemize}


Sign, exponent and fraction have the same identical meaning of the homonymous fields in IEEE binary numbers. 

The regime field is instead new and different. Its length depends on the value of the bits. In particular, the regime length depends on the number of subsequent identical bits that we find after the sign, until a bit of opposite value is found. This means that, if we have this bit-string:
\begin{equation}
    b_1, b_2, b_3 \dots b_l, \overline{b_{l}}
\end{equation}
 where $b_1 = b_2 = \dots = b_l = b$, the regime length will be $l$. Depending on the value of $b$ the regime value $k$ will be computed as follows:
 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:regimeValue}
k = \left\{\begin{matrix}
 l-1& b = 1  \\
 -l & b = 0  \\
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{equation}

The regime value is a \textit{scale factor} for a special constant, that depends on the posit configuration, called \textit{useed}. The useed value is compute as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:useed}
    \text{useed} = 2^{2^{esbits}}
\end{equation}

Wrapping everything up, the real value associated to a posit $p$ represented by the integer $P$ on two's complement (with sign $s$) is computed as in Equation \eqref{eqn:positRealValue}. The value $F$ is the length of the fraction field. Note that there will be always an implicit $1.$ in front of the fraction (i.e. $1.f_1,f_2, \dots, f_F$), without any subnormal number differently from IEEE binary numbers.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:positRealValue}
 r =   \left\{\begin{matrix}
0 & P = 0  \\
\pm \infty & P = -2^{nbits-1}  \\
(-1)^s \cdot \text{useed}^{k} \cdot 2^e \cdot \left ( 1+ \frac{f}{2^F} \right) &  \text{otherwise} \\
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{equation}


Having the exponent and the fraction bits depending on the length of the regime is a clever way to express the so-called \textit{tapered accuracy}: numbers near $1$ (in magnitude) will have more bits allocated for the fractional part than extremely large (or small) numbers farther from $1$, thus having higher decimal accuracy. Although it highly depends on the application, the probability of encountering such extremely large or small numbers is far smaller than the one for numbers near to 1. This theoretically gives a substantial boost to posit accuracy in computations.

Figures \ref{fig:positCloseToOne} and \ref{fig:positFarFromOne} show this concept with an example. The real value $1.125$ is closer to $1$ than the value $32704$: as we can see, the number of fraction bits in the former is far greater than the one on the latter. This also reflects on the \textit{denominator} of the fraction, being $2048$ in the case of the real value $1.125$ and a quarter of that $256$ for the real value $32704$.

Differently from binary32 numbers, the posit format does not have subnormal numbers. Indeed, the mantissa always has an implicit 1 and all numbers are considered in the same way. Furthermore, again in contrast with binary32 numbers, there is only one representation for infinite values or Not a Real (NaR) values. This particular bit string is represented by the integer $i = 2^{nbits - 1}$.

Given a \posit{nbits}{esbits} we can identify some important values that characterize the behaviour of the format, starting from the \textit{useed} value seen in \ref{eqn:useed}:
\[
\text{maxposit} = useed^{(nbits - 2)}
\]

\[
\text{minposit} = \frac{1}{maxposit}
\]

As explained at the beginning of this chapter, posit numbers can be projected on a circle, called \textit{posit ring}.

  \captionof{figure}{Projection of a \posit{5}{x}}
  \label{fig:posit5xRing}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:posit4xRing} and \ref{fig:posit5xRing} show the ring plot for a \posit{4}{x} and a \posit{5}{x} (exponent size is not relevant for the shape of the ring plot). The axis highlighted in \textbf{\textcolor{red}{red}} represents the real value $0$. The axis highlighted in \textbf{\textcolor{lightgreen}{green}} represents the real value $1$ and closes the first quarter of posit representations. The axis highlighted in \textbf{\textcolor{yellow}{yellow}} represents $\pm \infty$ (or \texttt{NaR}, depending on the configuration); this axis closes the quadrant where real values represented by posits are positive (note that also the integer representing the posit is positive). The axis highlighted in \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{blue}} represents the value $-1$. Note that these 4 points are fixed at south, west, north and east for any posit configuration. Indeed, they corresponds to the following posit integer representations: \textcolor{red}{0}, \textcolor{lightgreen}{$2^{nbits-2}$}, \textcolor{yellow}{$2^{nbits - 1}$} and \textcolor{blue}{$3 \cdot 2^{nbits-2}$}.

According to these two values we can explicate the rounding, overflow and underflow behaviour of the format:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If we are trying to represent a real value $0 < r < \text{minposit}$ we will saturate it to $minposit$ to avoid underflow to $0$.
    \item If we are trying to represent a real value $r > \text{maxposit} $
    \item If we are trying to represent a real value that lies between two exact posits, we need to round it to the nearest value (in terms of L2 distance).
\end{itemize}




\section{A focus on decimal accuracy}

As we said in the previous sub-section, since the posit format has a variable length field for the fraction, the decimal accuracy (i.e. the number of allocated fraction bits for a given number) varies across the posit domain.

In particular, the fraction field depends on the length of the regime and exponent fields; given a \posit{nbits}{esbits} the regime field can have a length 
\[
l_r \in [2,\text{nbits}-2]
\]
Consequently, the exponent field can have a length 
\[
l_e = \text{min}(\text{esbits},\text{nbits}-1-l_r)
\]

Finally, the fraction field can have a length:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fracFieldLength}
l_f = \text{nbits} - 1 - l_r - l_e
\end{equation}

Looking at the fraction field length in \ref{eqn:fracFieldLength}, we see that, when the regime value $k$ (see \ref{eqn:regimeValue}) increase in absolute value, the fraction field length decrease; this means that, when numbers are very large or very small (in absolute value) - i.e. numbers with large positive or negative regime values - the fraction field has fewer bits available for allocation. On the other hand, when the regime value decrease (in absolute value), the fraction field length increase; this means that, when numbers are very close to $1$ (in absolute value), the fraction field has more bits available for allocation. 

Having more bits available for the fraction means that we can represent more precisely numbers after the decimal dot.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/posit80fractionsWithZoom.png}
    \caption{\posit{8}{0} fraction length across the domain}
    \label{fig:posit80Fractions}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:posit80Fractions} shows this behaviour across the domain for a \posit{8}{0} configuration. In the plot we can see the region highlighted with the highest number of fraction bits with the associated real values $r \in [-1.9785,-0.5] \cup [0.5,1.9785]$


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/posit8xFractions.png}
    \caption{\posit{8}{x} fraction length comparison}
    \label{fig:posit8xFractions}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:posit8xFractions} shows the comparison of the fraction length between different configurations \posit{8}{[0,1,2]}. Obviously, if we allocate more bit for the exponent we are furtherly restricting the fraction bits, hence the different fraction bit lengths of the three configurations. However, with more exponent bits the range of maximum fraction bits is larger, despite containing the same number of distinct representations. This reflects on the format having a denser area of very high precision representation that thins out when we increase the exponent bits. 

We can generalize the range where the fraction has the highest amount of bits allocated:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:highestFractionBits}
    \left [ \frac{1}{\text{useed}} , \text{useed} \right [ = \left [ \frac{1}{2^{2^{\text{esbits}}}}, 2^{2^{\text{esbits}}} \right [
\end{equation}

As we can see from Figure \ref{fig:posit8xFractions}, this range is always symmetric around the y-axis, so we would have the two following ranges:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:highestFractionBitsFull}
 \left ] -\text{useed}, -\frac{1}{\text{useed}} \right ]  ; \left [ \frac{1}{\text{useed}} , \text{useed} \right [ 
\end{equation}

Note that both in \ref{eqn:highestFractionBits} and \ref{eqn:highestFractionBitsFull}, the set are open from the side of $\text{useed}$. This is because, by design, the last positive posit with the highest number fraction bits is the one immediately preceeding the posit representing $\text{useed}$.

\begin{table}[]
\caption{Ranges of the maximum fraction bits numbers for different posit configurations}
\label{tab:positXxMaxFractionRanges}

\begin{tabular}{c|rl}

 \posit{8}{2}               & $[-15.0, -0.0625]   $               & $[0.0625, 15.0]$         \\
 \posit{16}{0}              & $[-1.9998779296875, -0.5]$          & $[0.5, 1.9998779296875]$ \\
 \posit{16}{1}              & $[-3.99951171875, -0.25] $          & $[0.25, 3.99951171875]$  \\
 \posit{16}{2}              & $[-15.99609375, -0.0625]$           & $[0.0625, 15.99609375]$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:positXxMaxFractionRanges} summarizes the ranges of maximum fraction length for different posit configurations. As we can see the range span depends on the exponent bits (\textit{esbits}), while the decimal accuracy of the range bounds depend on the total number of bits (\textit{nbits}).

Another useful concept to understand the behaviour of posits across their domain is the \textit{resolution}. Given a pair of consecutive posit representations $p_1, p_2 = p_1 + 1; p_1, p_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$, we define resolution the value:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:positResolution}
    \overline{r} = r_2 - r_1
\end{equation}

Where $r_1,r_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ are the real values associated, respectively, to $p_1, p_2$. Resolution represents the inverse of \textit{density} of a given format in a given range of numbers: the lower the resolution, the closer the real values associated to two consecutive representation.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/posit8xResolutions.png}
    \caption{\posit{8}{\{0,1,2\}} resolution across a portion of domain}
    \label{fig:posit8xResolutions}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:posit8xResolutions} shows the plot of $\overline{r}$ when function of $p_1$ for three configurations of \posit{8}{x}. As we can see, the \textit{resolution} decreases when approaching the value $0$ on the x-axis. Furthermore, the value of $\overline{r}$ is always smaller when using less exponent bits, this means that, real numbers represented by successive posits are closer if compared to other posit configurations with higher number of bits. As reported, the configurations for \posit{x}{0} have a flat resolution in the range $\left [ -1, 1 \right]$. This behaviour will be deeply analyzed in Section \ref{sec:Posit0bitExponent}.

\section{Posit $\Leftrightarrow$ Floating point  interoperability}

One of the core concepts we deal with when bringing together the posit and the floating point domains is the interoperability between the two worlds. This means that we need to have a couple of functions $f,g$ such that, given a set of Posits $\mathbb{P}$ and a set of floating point $\mathbb{F}$:
\begin{equation}
    f: \mathbb{P} \xrightarrow[]{} \mathbb{F}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    g: \mathbb{F} \xrightarrow[]{} \mathbb{P}
\end{equation}

Note that these two functions must be independent from the posit configuration \posit{nbits}{esbits} and the floating point type.

We introduce a \textit{float intermediate representation} (FIR) - i.e. a contact interface between any posit and any float configuration. Similarly to an IEEE binary, a FIR interface has three fixed-length fields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item sign $s_f$ on $1$ bit
    \item exponent $e_f$ on $\text{E}_f$ bits
    \item fraction $f_f$ on $\text{F}_f$ bits
\end{itemize}

Differently from the IEEE binary formats, the exponent here is a \textit{pure} one, without any offset applied. This means that, the correspondent real value $r$ is:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:firEquation}
    r = (-1)^{s_f} \cdot 2^{e_f} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{f_f}{2^{F_f}} \right)
\end{equation}

This interface allows us to decouple any posit configuration from any floating point configuration for conversion. Instead, we define another couple of functions $f_{fir}, 
g_{fir}$ that convert a posit into the FIR space and vice-versa.

From the other side, we just need to provide yet another couple of functions for conversion between FIR and floating point space.

We can now characterize the two functions $f_{fir}, g_{fir}$ comparing Equations \eqref{eqn:positRealValue} and \eqref{eqn:firEquation}. If we take the general case from \eqref{eqn:positRealValue} and we expand the $useed$ term with \eqref{eqn:useed} we obtain:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:positRealExpanded}
    r = (-1)^s_p \cdot 2^{2^{esbits} \cdot k + e_p} \cdot \left ( 1+ \frac{f_p}{2^{F_p}} \right)
\end{equation}

If we compare Equation \eqref{eqn:positRealExpanded} and \eqref{eqn:firEquation} we can impose equality on the three terms of the multiplication. The sign equality is straightforward: the sign of the number in FIR format will match the posit one.

If we are converting from posit to FIR, we can obtain the exponent $e_f$ as:
\begin{equation}
    e_f = 2^{esbits} \cdot k + e_p
\end{equation}

If we are converting the other way we can obtain $k$ and $e_p$ using modular arithmetic in base $2$.
\begin{equation}
    k = e_f\ \mathbf{mod}\ 2^{esbits} = \left\lfloor \frac{e_f}{2^{esbits}} \right\rfloor
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    e_p = e_f\ \mathbf{rem}\ 2^{esbits}
\end{equation}

Where $\mathbf{mod}$ is the integer division quotient and $\mathbf{rem}$ is the remainder.

For the fraction we need to impose the equality:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fractionalPartEquivalence}
    \frac{f_f}{2^{F_f}} = \frac{f_p}{2^{F_p}}
\end{equation}

Then we can solve for $f_f$ as:
\begin{equation}
    f_f = f_p \cdot 2^{F_f - F_p}
\end{equation}

and we can solve for $f_p$ as:
\begin{equation}
    f_p = f_f \cdot 2^{F_p - F_f}
\end{equation}

Note that, depending on the fraction sizes, the operation may result in loss of information, when we shrink a fraction with more bits to one with less bits.  Therefore, we need to take into account the bits we are discarding to eventually round the destination format according to their value.

So far, we have covered the conversion between FIR and posit numbers. The conversion between FIR and actual IEEE binary (or whichever floating point format) is similar, if not simpler.

Let us consider the IEEE binary32 conversion from/to a given FIR format. 

The exponent $e_{b32}$ of a binary32 number must be offset by $127$ during transition between the two formats. Therefore, given $e_f$ the FIR exponent, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    e_{b32} = e_f + 127
\end{equation}

On the other hand:
\begin{equation}
    e_{f} = e_{b32} - 127
\end{equation}

The fractional part can be handled as in \ref{eqn:fractionalPartEquivalence}. Note that, differently from posit numbers, when the exponent is $0$, the fractional part of a binary32 needs to be interpreted without the leading $1.$ (i.e. the number must be considered as a subnormal).

The approach of using an intermediate representation can be used between whichever formats for real numbers that can be represented in the sign, exponent and fraction format.

\cfr{Qualche esempino, anche con un subnormal}

\section{Generalized posits}

As seen in Figures \ref{fig:posit80Fractions} and \ref{fig:posit8xFractions}, the regime length has a sensible impact on the number of fraction bits we can use across the domain. Such length can change to the point where we do not have sufficient decimal accuracy in a given range of numbers. 

An ideal approach would be to impose an upper limit to the regime length such that we can be sure that we will always reserve at least some bits for the fraction.

In \cite{9151086}, the authors propose a new way to characterize a posit numbers. Additionally to the \textit{nbits}  and \textit{esbits} parameters, there are two (mutually exclusive) new hyper-parameters that control the dynamic range:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K_b$: a regime bias 
    \item $rs$: a limit on the regime length
\end{itemize}

This results in having the maximum posit value shifted at:
\begin{equation}
    2^{2^{esbits} \cdot (k-K_b)}
\end{equation}

if using the $K_b$ parameter, or if we use the $rs$ parameter:
\begin{equation}
    2^{2^{esbits} \cdot rs} \cdot (1 - 2^{es - t - 1})
\end{equation}

where $ t = n - rs - 1$
\section{A special case: 0-bit exponent}\label{sec:Posit0bitExponent}

In this Section we focus on the posit format when configured with 0 exponent bits (i.e. \posit{x}{0}), also referring to our work in \cite{coco2020sensors}. If we impose $esbits = 0$ - that means also $es = 0$ - in \ref{eqn:positRealValue}, we get:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:positRealValueExp0}
    (-1)^s \cdot \text{2}^{k} \cdot \left ( 1+ \frac{f}{2^F} \right)
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/posit8xDensities.png}
    \caption{\posit{8}{x} density distribution around $0$.}
    \label{fig:posit8xDistributions}
\end{figure}

since $useed = 2^{2^0} = 2$. Having no exponent bits results in the behaviour shown in Figures \ref{fig:posit8xFractions} and \ref{fig:posit8xDistributions}. In particular, looking at Figure \ref{fig:posit8xDistributions} the density distribution of a \posit{8}{0} tends to decay slower when moving away from the origin , thus having a better coverage in the range $[-useed,useed]$ when compared to posits with more exponent bits. This can be also seen in Figure \ref{fig:posit8xResolutions}, where the resolution of \posit{8}{0} is constant in $[-1,1]$ while the resolution of the other two posits increases also in this range. 

As we mentioned in the previous section, a 0-exponent bit posit in the range $[-1,1]$ has the property of having a constant resolution. 

We know that the fraction length $F_p$ depends on the regime length $l$ and, as as a consequence, on the regime value $k$. In the range $[-1,1]$ we also know that the regime value is always $k \leq 0$, with the equality holding for posit representing real values of $\pm 1$. This means that, in this region the associated length (excluding the regime stop bit) will be $l = - k$. This means that the fraction length $F$ can be written as $nbits - l - 2$, where $2$ includes the sign-bit and regime stop bit. We can rewrite \eqref{eqn:positRealValueExp0} as:
\begin{equation}
    (-1)^s \cdot 2^k \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{f_p}{2^{nbits + k - 2}} \right )
\end{equation}

If we distribute the term $2^k$ inside the parenthesis we obtain:

\begin{equation}
    (-1)^s \cdot \left ( 2^k + \frac{f_p\cdot 2^2}{2^{nbits}} \right )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    (-1)^s \cdot \left ( \frac{2^{k+nbits}}{2^{nbits}} + \frac{f_p\cdot 2^2}{2^{nbits}} \right )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    (-1)^s \cdot \left ( \frac{2^{k+nbits} + f_p\cdot 2^2}{2^{nbits}} \right )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    (-1)^s \cdot \left ( \frac{2^2 \cdot (2^{k+ nbits - 2} + f_p)}{2^{nbits}} \right )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:posit0exponentInUnitaryRange}
    (-1)^s \cdot \left ( \frac{2^2 \cdot (2^{F_p} + f_p)}{2^{nbits}} \right )
\end{equation}

Note that the value $2^{F_p} + f_p$ represents exactly the last $F_p + 1$ bits of the posit, since the fraction numerator $f_p$ is exactly $F_p$ bits long. However, since the regime bits are in the format $000 \cdots 01$ and $2^{F_p}$ represents exactly the $1$ stopping bit, the integer $P$ representing the posit is exactly:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:posit0expUnitary}
    P = 2^{F_p} + f_p
\end{equation}

We can compare \eqref{eqn:posit0exponentInUnitaryRange} with \eqref{eqn:fixed2real}. In order to impose the equality between the two equations, $2^2 \cdot ( 2^{F_p} + f_p )$ must be equal to $f$ and $nbits$ must be equal to $F$. in \eqref{eqn:fixed2real}. Then, the integral part $i$ must be 0, since we are in the unitary range.

Therefore,  a \posit{x}{0} in the range $[-1,1]$ is equivalent to a fixed-point on $2\cdot x$ bits with a fractional part equal to $2^2 \cdot ( 2^{F_p} + f_p )$.

In practice, given a \posit{x}{0} we can just shift the posit representation two places left (hence the $2^2$ in \eqref{eqn:posit0exponentInUnitaryRange}) to obtain the fractional part of the correspondent fixed point number without any rounding.

\subsection{Fast arithmetic operation implementation
}

Having a format with $0$ exponent bits opens the door to implement several arithmetic operations in a way that does not require decoding of the posit itself, possibly introducing an approximation.

Hereafter we will present the mathematical formulation of several operators and then in Section \ref{sec:cppPositCore} we will evaluate performance and approximation error of such operations.

Let us start with the reciprocate operation \begin{equation}
    y = \frac{1}{x}
\end{equation}

Firstly, we need to distinguish the formulation shown in \eqref{eqn:posit0exponentInUnitaryRange} from one on the range  $]-\infty,-1] \cup [1,\infty[$. When in this range, the regime value is always $k \geq 0$ ,  hence $l = k + 1$. This means that the number of bits for the fraction is $F = nbits - k - 3$. We can then write two different formulation for the real value associated to a \posit{x}{0}, where $r^- \in (-1,1)$ and $r^+ \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [1,\infty)$:
\begin{equation}
   r^- =  (-1)^s \cdot 2^k \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{f_p}{2^{nbits + k - 2}} \right )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
   r^+ = (-1)^s \cdot 2^k \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{f_p}{2^{nbits - k - 3}} \right )
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Inverse}

Now, let us have $x, y = \frac{1}{x}$ represented  by two posits with, respectively $s_x,k_x, f_x$ and $s_y = s_x, k_y, f_y$. Since there is an inversion, if $x \in [-1,1]$ then $y \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [1,\infty)$ (or vice-versa). We want to express $x \cdot y \sim 1$ using the posit representation of a real:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:positx0prodInverse}
    x \cdot y = 2^{k_x+k_y} \cdot \left[ \left (1 + \frac{f_x}{2^{2^{nbits + k_x - 2}}} \right ) \cdot \left (1 + \frac{f_y}{2^{2^{nbits - k_y - 3}}} \right ) \right] \sim 1
\end{equation}

We need to distinguish two cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[a)]$f_x = 0$, i.e. x is a pure exponential number and has an exact inversion in the posit space representation
    \item[b)] $f_x \neq 0$, i.e. x has also a fractional part and it has not an exact inversion in the posit space representation
\end{itemize}

We can easily test the case with the following expression, let $P$ being the integer representing the posit number, the number is a pure exponential one if: 
\begin{equation}
    P\ \mathbf{and}\ (P - 1) = 0
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Case a)} When in case a), we know that $k_y = -k_x$ (from inversion of \eqref{eqn:positRealValueExp0}). If we substitute this in \eqref{eqn:positx0prodInverse} we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    x \cdot y = 2^{0} \cdot \left[ \left (1 + \frac{f_x}{2^{2^{nbits + k_x - 2}}} \right ) \cdot \left (1 + \frac{f_y}{2^{2^{nbits + k_x - 3}}} \right ) \right] \sim 1
\end{equation}

We then develop the product inside the square brackets, discarding the product between the fraction themselves, introducing no approximation since $f_x = f_y = 0$:

\begin{equation}
    x \cdot y = 2^{0} \cdot \left[ 1 + \frac{f_x}{2^{2^{nbits + k_x - 2}}}  + \frac{f_y}{2^{2^{nbits + k_x - 3}}} \right] \sim 1
\end{equation}

Since the number must be equal to $1$, we impose the fractional part to be $0$, therefore:
\begin{equation}
    f_x + 2\cdot f_y = 0
\end{equation}

Since we already know that $f_x$ and $f_y$ are $0$, this holds by construction. 

Therefore, in this case the only transformation needed is $k_y = -k_x$. Since $k_x \leq 0$, changing the sign reflects on the lenght being increased by $1$. This means that the regime bits must be flipped and another bit of the same value must be appended to the regime. Since the $f_x = 0$, if we invert it and add $1$ we get a bit set on the F-th least significant bit - i.e. on the former regime stop-bit. Wrapping everything up, we can obtain the inverse of $y$ with this expression, being $X$,$Y$ the integer numbers representing the posits:
\begin{equation}
    Y = X\ \mathbf{xor}\ (2^{nbits - 1} - 1) + 1
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Case b)} When in case b), $k_y = -k_x - 1$ (again from the inversion of \eqref{sec:Posit0bitExponent}). If we substitute this again \eqref{eqn:positx0prodInverse} we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    x \cdot y = 2^{-1} \cdot \left[ \left (1 + \frac{f_x}{2^{2^{nbits + k_x - 2}}} \right ) \cdot \left (1 + \frac{f_y}{2^{2^{nbits + k_x - 2}}} \right ) \right] \sim 1
\end{equation}

Again, we develop the product inside square brackets, discarding the fraction product, now introducing an approximation:

\begin{equation}
    x \cdot y = 2^{-1} \cdot \left[ 1 + \frac{f_x}{2^{2^{nbits + k_x - 2}}}  + \frac{f_y}{2^{2^{nbits + k_x - 2}}} \right] \sim 1
\end{equation}

Since the product must be $\sim 1$, we solve by $f_y$, obtaining:
\begin{equation}
\left\{\begin{matrix}
k_y = -k_x - 1 \\
f_y = 2^{F_x} - f_x
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{equation}

When changing the sign of $k_x$ we are acting like in case a), increasing the length of the regime by $1$ and changing its sign. However now we also subtract $1$ from it, thus maintaining the regime length identical. This equals to just flipping the regime bits.  For the fraction we are subtracting an integer on $F_x$ bits - that is $f_x$ - from the value $2^F_x$. This again is equal to flipping $f_x$ bits and adding $1$. Since the case of $f_x = 0$ is not possible in b), this operation will never overflow $F_x$ bits, hence we can flip all the posit bits (obviusly excluding the sign) and adding $1$. Wrapping everything up we will obtain, let $X,Y$ be the integers representing the posits:

\begin{equation}
    Y = X\ \mathbf{xor}\ (2^{nbits - 1} - 1) + 1
\end{equation}


We obtained that in both cases a) and b) the formulation for the inversion is the same, so we can fuse the two cases int one. However, the second case will introduce, inevitably, an approximation since we discarded the product between fractions inside the square brackets.

\subsubsection{$\mathbf{2\cdot x}$ and $\mathbf{x/2}$}

Let us proceed with the $y = 2\cdot x$ operation. For this operation we need to distinguish three ranges for the real value $r$:


\begin{itemize}
    \item[a)] $r \in (-0.5,0] \cup [0,0.5) \xrightarrow{} 2\cdot r \in (-1,1)$
    \item[b)] $r \in (-1,-0.5] \cup [0.5,1) \xrightarrow{} 2\cdot r \in (-2,-1] \cup [1,2) $
    \item[c)] $r \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)  \xrightarrow{} 2\cdot r \in (-\infty, -2] \cup [2, \infty)$
\end{itemize}

Regardless of the case we are in, we can write the following expression for the operation $y = 2 \cdot x$:

\begin{equation}
    y = 2 \cdot x = (-1)^{s_x} \cdot 2^{k_x + 1} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{f_x}{2^{F_x}} \right) 
\end{equation}

This means that, for all the cases, $k_y = k_x + 1$

For symmetry, we can focus only on the positive quadrant of the posit ring. The values $0.5,1,2$ are, respectively, represented by the integers $2^{nbits - 3}, 2^{nbits - 2}, 2^{nbits - 2} + 2^{nbits - 3}$.

\paragraph{Case a)} When $x \in [0,0.5)$ we know that $k_x \leq 0$, therefore $l_x = -k_x$. We also know that $y = 2\cdot x = \in [0,1)$, therefore $k_y \leq 0$ and $l_y = -k_y$. If we substitute the equivalence  $k_y = k_x + 1$ we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    l_y = - (k_x + 1) = l_x - 1
\end{equation}


In case a), we know that both $k_x, k_y$ will be in the $000 \dots 01$. In particular, after multiplying by $2$, the regime length of $y$ will be shorter by 1. This corresponds to shifting the posit one position to the left. Since we are operating on positive numbers, we are guaranteed that the sign is preserved. Let $X,Y$ being the integer for the posits that represent $x,y$:
\begin{equation}
    Y = \mathbf{lls} (X,2) = 2 \cdot X
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{lls}(X,N)$ is the logical left shift of the integer $X$ of $N$ positions.

\paragraph{Case b)} When $x \in [0.5,1)$ we know that $k_x \leq 0$ again. Hence, $l_x = -k_x$. In this case, $y = 2\cdot x \in [1,2)$, thus $k_y \geq 0$ and $l_y = k_x + 2$. Substituting the equivalence $k_y = k_x + 1$ we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    l_y = 2 - l_x
\end{equation}

Note that when $esbits = 0$, the range expressed in \eqref{eqn:highestFractionBits} is $[0.5,2)$ This means that $\forall x \in [0.5,2), l_x = 1$ and, as a consequence, we will always have $l_y = 2 - l_x = 1$. While $l_x = 1$ for a negative $k_x = -1$, $l_y = 1$ for a positive $k_y = 1$. This means that we need to flip the regime bits. Since we are in the region with the minimum number of regime bits (i.e. 2 regime bits, including the stopping bit), we just need to flip the 2 most significant bits (ignoring the sign). Let $X,Y$ being the integer for the posits that represent $x,y$:
\begin{equation}
    Y = X\ \mathbf{xor}\ (2^{nbits - 2} + 2^{nbits - 3})
\end{equation}


\paragraph{Case c)} When $x \in [1,\infty)$ we know that both $k_x \geq 0$ and $k_y \geq 0$. Therefore, $l_x = k_x + 1$ and $l_y = k_y + 1$. Substituting the equivalence $k_y = k_x + 1$ we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    l_y = l_x + 1
\end{equation}

In this case the regime bits are in the format $111 \cdots 10$. When we multiply by two we are increasing the regime and the regime length by $1$. This means that we need to put a single bit set in front of the regime and then shift the posit to the right (possibly discarding the fraction least significant bit). Let $X,Y$ being the integer for the posits that represent $x,y$:
\begin{equation}
    Y = (X\ \mathbf{or}\ 2^{nbits - 1}) \cdot 2^{-1}
\end{equation}

Note that we can elaborate in the same way for the $x/2$ operations, obtaining symmetrical results.

\subsubsection{$\mathbf{1-x}$}

Suppose we are in the $[0,1]$ range and we want to perform the \textit{unitary complement} of a number $x$, that is:
\begin{equation}
    y = 1 - x    
\end{equation}

As seen before in \eqref{eqn:posit0expUnitary}, in the unitary range the posit integer $P = 2^{F_p} + f_p$. 

To derive an expression for this complement operation we can write $x + y = 1$ and expand the terms:
\begin{equation}
    2^{k_x} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{f_x}{2^{F_x}} \right) + 2^{k_y} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{f_y}{2^{F_y}} \right) = 1
\end{equation}

When in the unitary range we already know that $k \leq 1$ and $F = nbits - 2 + k$. If we substitute this in both the terms of the addition we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    2^{k_x} + \ 2^{k_y} + \frac{f_x + f_y}{2^{nbits - 2}} = 1
\end{equation}

We multiply both sides by $2^{nbits - 2}$ obtaining:
\begin{equation}
    2^{F_x} + 2^{F_y} + f_x + f_y = 2^{nbits - 2}
\end{equation}

We then apply  \eqref{eqn:posit0expUnitary}, obtaining the expression needed to compute $y = 1 - x$:
\begin{equation}
    X + Y = 2^{nbits - 2} \xrightarrow{} Y = 2^{nbits - 2} - X
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Sigmoid}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/sigmoidPosit160.png}
    \caption{Actual sigmoid vs plot of the integer representation of a \posit{16}{0}}
    \label{fig:posit160Sigmoid}
\end{figure}

In \cite{gustafson2017beating} John L. Gustafson et al. observed a particular property of the posit representation when plotting the integer value representing the posit and the correspondent real value.

The sigmoid curve is a very well known activation function for neural networks:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{sigmoid}(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\end{equation}

If we look at Figure \ref{fig:posit160Sigmoid} we can see that actual sigmoid curve is very similar to the other curve obtained plotting the value of the integer $P$ representing a posit $p$ for any correspondent real value $r$. However the plot for $P$ must be scaled and translated to match the sigmoid output in $[0,1]$. The scale and translation are performed as follows, let $\hat{S}(x)$ be the \textit{pseudo-sigmoid} shown in figure \ref{fig:posit160Sigmoid}, and $X$ the integer representing the posit associated to the real value $x$:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{S}(x) = \frac{X}{2^{nbits}} + \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

In \cite{gustafson2017beating} the authors reported another version of this transformation, obtaining the posit integer representation for the sigmoid output from the posit integer representation of its input. Let $Y$ be the integer posit representation for the sigmoid $\hat{S}(x)$ and $X$ the posit integer representation associated to the real value $x$:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pseudoSigmoidPosit0}
    Y = \left ( 2^{nbits - 2} + \frac{X}{2} \right ) \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

As pointed out in \cite{coco2020sensors}, the two expressions are equivalent.

\subsubsection{Hyperbolic tangent}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/tanhPosit160.png}
    \caption{Hyperbolic tangent comparison between actual and pesudo version}
    \label{fig:pseudoTanhPosit0}
\end{figure}

The hyperbolic tangent is another commonly used activation function in neural networks. Its expression is quite similar to the sigmoid:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{tanh}(x) = \frac{e^{2x}-1}{e^{2x}+1} 
\end{equation}

We can obtain this expression from the sigmoid by applying a scale and a transformation:

\begin{equation}
   \mathbf{tanh}(x) =  2 \cdot \mathbf{sigmoid}(2 \cdot x) - 1
\end{equation}

We can rework the previous expression as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{tanh}(x) = - ( 1 - 2\cdot \mathbf{sigmoid}(2\cdot x))
\end{equation}

Suppose we only consider negative values for $x$ for symmetry. We know that the $2\cdot x$ operation can be done without decoding with \posit{x}{0}. Since we are dealing with negative numbers, the output of the sigmoid will be in $[0,1/2]$. Again, multiplying this number by $2$ can be done without decoding the posit and the output will be in $[0,1]$. Therefore, we can apply the $1-y$ operation without the decoding the posit. Finally we can change the sign with a 2's complement of the representation.

If we substitute the sigmoid with the pseudo-sigmoid seen in \eqref{eqn:pseudoSigmoidPosit0} we obtain a decoding-free \textit{pseudo hyperbolic tangent}.

\subsubsection{Extended Linear Unit}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/eluPosit160.png}
    \caption{ELU comparison between actual and pesudo version}
    \label{fig:pseudoEluPosit0}
\end{figure}


The Extended Linear Unit (ELU) is yet another commonly used activation function in neural networks, mainly adopted to avoid vanishing gradients of S-shaped functions like sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent.

The formulation of the ELU function is the following:

\begin{equation}
\left\{\begin{matrix}
x & x \geq 0 \\
\alpha \cdot (e^x - 1) & x < 0  \\
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{equation}

The case for $x \geq 0$ is straightforward, so we focus on the $\alpha \cdot (e^x - 1)$ part. In particular we consider the case where $\alpha = 1$, hence:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{elu}(x) = (e^x - 1) = 2 \cdot \left [ \frac{1}{2\cdot \mathbf{sigmoid}(-x)} - 1 \right]
\end{equation}

We can start from the sigmoid before. We firstly negate the argument to have a sigmoid output in $[0.5,1]$. We can then invert without decoding obtaining an output in $[1,2]$. This output is divided by $2$, obtaining an output in $[0.5,1]$. We can apply the $1-y$ operation without decoding and then multiply everything by $2$ to obtain the final result in \eqref{eqn:sigm_twinvm1}.

\begin{align}
   \label{eqn:sigm_mx}\textnormal{sigmoid}(-x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{x}}  & \\
   \label{eqn:sigm_invx}1/\textnormal{sigmoid}(-x) = 1+e^x & \\
   \label{eqn:sigm_invtw}1/(2\cdot\textnormal{sigmoid}(-x)) = \frac{1+e^x}{2}& \\
   \label{eqn:sigm_invm1}1/(2\cdot\textnormal{sigmoid}(-x))-1 = \frac{1+e^x}{2} - 1 = \frac{e^x-1}{2} & \\
  \label{eqn:sigm_twinvm1}2\cdot[1/(2\cdot\textnormal{sigmoid}(-x))-1] = e^x -1&
\end{align}

If we substitute the sigmoid function with the pseud-sigmoid seen in \eqref{eqn:pseudoSigmoidPosit0} we obtain a decoding-free \textit{pseudo-ELU}.
